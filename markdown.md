Here is what the applicaitons purpose is:

To take articles from the Disney Sites blog and render them to a seperate page.  From there you can add a comment to that exact article, you can save it and delete it.

Here's where my application is at so far.  I am able to run the application on a local setting.  I have spent over 3 hours trying to deploy to Heroku without any success.

There are still 2 functions I would need to complete to make this application fully functional:

1) I am still working on the delete functionality of the application.  I am able to pinpoint the exact article I want to remove but I am not utilizing the proper syntax to remove it from the database.

2) I still need to create a saved option.

Those are the last few things I need to get done (I am including needing to fix Heroku).  Will continue to work on it but wanted to extend this mark down if I don't have any more breakthroughs.
